# ðŸ”„ Continuous Listening Mode - Enhanced Interview Assistant

## What's New?

Your AI Interview Assistant now features **Continuous Listening Mode** - after answering one question, the system automatically clears the previous question and immediately starts listening for the next question!

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Live Mode with Continuous Listening

1. **Start Live Mode**: Click the "Go Live" button
2. **Choose Mode**: 
   - **Auto Mode** (ðŸ¤–): Questions are automatically detected and answered
   - **Manual Mode** (âœ‹): Questions are detected but you click "Send" to confirm

3. **Continuous Cycle**:
   ```
   Listen for Question â†’ Detect Question â†’ Provide Answer â†’ Clear Question â†’ Ready for Next Question
   ```

### Enhanced Flow

#### With Audio Enabled:
1. System detects interview question
2. Displays question and generates answer
3. Types out the answer with bullet points
4. Speaks the answer aloud
5. **NEW**: After speech completes, automatically:
   - Clears the previous question
   - Resets detection flags
   - Provides audio feedback: "Ready for next question"
   - Continues ambient listening

#### With Audio Disabled:
1. System detects interview question
2. Displays question and generates answer
3. Types out the answer with bullet points
4. **NEW**: Immediately after typing completes:
   - Clears the previous question
   - Resets detection flags
   - Provides console feedback: "Ready for next question - audio disabled mode"
   - Continues ambient listening

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
